            Looking ahead, we are excited to announce plans for developing our own proprietary exchange rate API. This upcoming feature will give us full control over the data pipeline, allowing for greater flexibility, customization, and the potential to offer new services, such as enhanced historical data analysis and tailored rate calculations. By creating our own API, we aim to improve performance, scalability, and provide an innovative platform for developers and users alike. Stay tuned as we work to make this vision a reality!
